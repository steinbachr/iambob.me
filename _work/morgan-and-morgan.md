    At Morgan & Morgan, I've experienced tremendous personal growth. Coming in as a Lead Developer, my initial focus was on
    streamlining our teams' development process, modernizing infrastructure, and maintaining and developing our family of sites. Since
    March 2018, my role has been switched to Director of Engineering and - with that - a host of new responsibilities has shifted my way.
