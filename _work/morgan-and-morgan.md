    *December 2016 - Present*

    At Morgan & Morgan, I've experienced tremendous personal growth. Coming in as a Lead Developer, my initial focus was on
    streamlining our teams' development process, modernizing infrastructure, and maintaining and expanding our family of sites. Since
    March 2018, my position has been switched to Director of Engineering and - with that - has come a host of new responsibilities.
    These days I'm primarily occupied with managing the engineering team's development, supporting and interfacing with the analytics and paid media teams,
    and (the best part of my job!) building out high-value growth services and products.
