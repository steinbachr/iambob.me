    *September 2013 - April 2014*

    TheShelf was my first position after graduating college and where I first started developing my
    love of startups (and entrepreneurship). Being the first engineering hire at the influencer analytics company, I developed a great relationship with the founders,
    built out the platform, and aided in developing company strategy and culture. Unfortunately, the company was based in Las Vegas and - though its a great place to visit -
    living there is just, not the best. So, as much as I loved the company and people, I was forced to resign in order to come back to the East Coast.
